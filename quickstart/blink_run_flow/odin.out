High-level synthesis Begin
Parser starting - we'll create an abstract syntax tree. Note this tree can be viewed using Grap Viz (see documentation)
Adding file blink.v to parse list
Optimizing module by AST based optimizations
Converting AST into a Netlist. Note this netlist can be viewed using GraphViz (see documentation)
==========================
Detected Top Level Module: 	blink
==========================
Performing Optimizations of the Netlist
Performing Partial Map to target device
Outputting the netlist to the specified output format
Successful High-level synthesis by Odin
	Blif file available at blink.odin.blif
